# Matlab/Octave Code for Artificial Neural Networks

Simple neural network code written in pure Octave/Matlab inspired by [Andrew Ng](http://andrewng.com)'s [Machine Learning Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome).

The code for training a neural network is surprisingly concise, only a dozen lines of code or so (see `nn_train.m` and `nn_predict.m`).
